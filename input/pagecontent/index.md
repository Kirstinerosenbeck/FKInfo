### Introduction
This implementation guide is provided to support the use of FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> in a Danish MedCom context.

### Scope

This document presents Danish use concepts defined via FHIR processable artefacts:

* [Profiles](profiles.html) - are useful constraints of core FHIR resources and datatype for Danish use
* [Extensions](extensions.html) - are FHIR extensions that are added for local use, covering needed Danish concepts
* [Terminologies](terminology.html) - are defined or referenced code systems and value sets for Danish context

### Governance
